Hi Everyone,

Thank you for visiting my personal website! Now I want to tell you a little about myself.

My name is Jason Durant and I am using this website to document my journey into Computer Vision which will hopefully help others learn as well. Secondly, I want to dicuss my other favorite topic which is bread which I love to bake and which provides inspiration for the name of my blog. Below, I provide a bit more of my personal history.

Currently, I am a Computer Science Masters student at Columbia University focusing on Computer Vision. Prior to being at Columbia University, I was a self-taught software engineer for 4 years working on backend advertising infrastructure and mobile gaming backend data engineering. This experience has allowed me work with Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Azure and program in a multitude of languages (e.g. JAVA, C++, C, Python, PHP, and Golang). After working for two years I decided to further my learning in a more academic setting and enrolled in Computer Science classes at City College of San Francisco. After successfully completing several courses, I was admitted to Columbia Univeristy where I aim to advance my knowledge of Computer Vision and eventually pursue a career in Computer Vision as a Computer Vision Engineer.

If you want to learn more about my professional experience feel free to view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/durantjason/). However, if you want to reach out to me directly regarding internships or full-time offers feel free to send an email to [jd3720@columbia.edu](mailto:jd3720@columbia.edu).
